Additional description about the project and its features.
In this Microverse capstone project, I was required to build a personalized online shop having been given design specifications. 
With this in mind, I decided to build an online health shop.
It has two pages; one for the home page and the other for the search results page.
The project also required building versions for 2 different screen sizes (i.e mobile and tablet/desktop).
